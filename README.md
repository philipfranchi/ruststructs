# DataStructures in Rust

This repo is a way of keeping track of what I'm learning to make in Rust. I'm aiming for some key datastrucutres and algorithms:

## The Nodes
- [LinkedList](https://github.com/philipfranchi/ruststructs/blob/master/linkedlist/README.md)
- Doubly LinkedList
- ArrayBacked Lists
- Stack
- Binary Tree
- Self Balanced Tree
- Generic Graph
- Heap

## The Algorithms
- Binary Search
- All manner of graph traversal

## The Tables
- An Array? From Scratch?
- A Hash Table
- Bloom Filter
